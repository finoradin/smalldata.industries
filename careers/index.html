		<h1>Come work with us</h1>
		
		<p><i>We are</i> a start-up consultancy specializing in the conservation, display, access, and management of collections of Time-Based Media Art, and we are looking to fill a new full-time senior-level position in our growing team. Our diverse and international list of clients includes institutions, art collectors, galleries, and artists. Day-to-day activities – at our Brooklyn headquarters, and on-site with clients – can include conservation treatment and documentation of an artwork, a strategy meeting with a museum director, a workshop with various stakeholders, time spent developing a roadmap for implementing digital preservation on a shoestring budget for an emerging artist’s studio, or research of emerging technologies being employed by artists.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p><i>You are</i> an expertly skilled communicator, and a highly motivated self-starter. People always tell you that you are great at making sense of and explaining complex things. You are passionate about art. You love to travel. You know your art history. You are organized, fastidious, and careful. Your ability to analyze a complex situation and derive a vision and perspective is unparalleled. You are a computer whiz. If someone was watching over your shoulder while you used a computer, they would probably ask “how did you do that”? You are interested in helping to shape the culture of a young and up-and-coming company.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>

		<p>Qualifications: we seek an experienced candidate, but, because of the diverse and hybrid nature of the work we do, there are a few different specializations we are open to considering. Perhaps you are a trained art conservator and have been retraining and learning the technical skills related to Time-Based Media. Perhaps you are an audiovisual archivist, but have found yourself working in the conservation field. Perhaps you are more thoroughly coming from the world of digital preservation, but have been looking for a way to apply these skills to working in the conservation field.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>

		<p>
		Desired skills and qualifications (any combination of the following - the more the better)
		<ol style="list-style-type: circle;margin-left: 1em">
			<li><p>Art historical knowledge and expertise</li>
			<li><p>Knowledge of the materials and technologies employed by contemporary artists</li>
			<li><p>Experience working in or with institutions</li>
			<li><p>Experience working in or with the commercial art world</li>
			<li><p>Consulting experience</li>
			<li><p>Contemporary art conservation theory, techniques, and ethics</li>
			<li><p>Knowledge of metadata standards for cultural heritage</li>
			<li><p>Knowledge of enterprise digital storage technologies and platforms</li>
			<li><p>Experience with digital preservation tools, techniques, and products</li>
			<li><p>Knowledge of digital preservation standards</li>
			<li><p>Ability to identify analog and digital audiovisual formats</li>
			<li><p>Knowledge of and/or experience with software development methods, conventions, and practices</li>
			<li><p>Knowledge of and/or experience with distributed version control systems</li>
		</ol>
